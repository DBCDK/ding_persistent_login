Provide persistent login credentials for Ding users.

Requires: ding_user 7.x-0.19 (from DBCDK)
          persistent_login 7.x-1.x

The Persistent Login module provides the familiar "Remember Me" option in the user login form to keep the user logged in.
However, the Ding user session is timed out after 15 minutes.
This module extend the persistent_login module with a persistent ding_user cache that is syncronized with the persistent login.
